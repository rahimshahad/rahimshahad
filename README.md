# 👋 Hi, I’m @rahimshahad

## Full Stack Web Developer
I am a full-stack web developer with a background in petroleum engineering and experience working in customer service. Whilst completing my bachelor's degree, I developed an interest in programming after taking a Visual Basic intro class. I particularly excel when working in teams to deliver creative and effective solutions. I have also proven to be adept at learning new technologies as in the past year I have learnt at least 5 new technologies and frameworks. Consequently, I plan to use this knowledge to work in the tech space as a software developer.
